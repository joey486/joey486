# Hi there, I'm Joey!

I'm a developer with a passion for building clean and scalable software â€” from sleek Flutter apps to low-level compiler backends. Currently working as a **Frontend Developer at Hudi**, where I craft responsive, performant UIs using **Flutter** with a custom **token-based design system** powered by [Mix](https://pub.dev/packages/mix).

---

## What I'm Working On

- **Building design systems** with token-based architecture (spacing, radius, colors, typography) in Flutter.
- **Writing a Jack compiler backend in Lean**, including optimizations like:
  - Constant Folding
  - Dead Code Elimination
  - Common Subexpression Elimination (via DAG)
  - Loop-Invariant Code Motion
- Developing a **React Vector Calculator** with 2D/3D vector operations and canvas-based visualization.
