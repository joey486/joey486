# 👋 Hi there, I'm Joey!

I'm a developer with a passion for building clean and scalable software — from sleek Flutter apps to low-level compiler backends. Currently working as a **Frontend Developer at Hudi**, where I craft responsive, performant UIs using **Flutter** with a custom **token-based design system** powered by [Mix](https://pub.dev/packages/mix).

---

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

- 🧩 **Building design systems** with token-based architecture (spacing, radius, colors, typography) in Flutter.
- 🔧 **Writing a Jack compiler backend in Lean**, including optimizations like:
  - Constant Folding
  - Dead Code Elimination
  - Common Subexpression Elimination (via DAG)
  - Loop-Invariant Code Motion
- 🧮 Developing a **React Vector Calculator** with 2D/3D vector operations and canvas-based visualization.
- 🎮 Modding and exploring the internals of **Fallout: New Vegas**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

### 👨‍💻 Languages:
- **Dart** (Flutter) – UI development, design systems
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – React, Canvas API, DOM scripting
- **Python** – Compiler design, data generation, scripting
- **C++** – Systems programming, code generation
- **SQL** – Database design, ERD modeling, query optimization
- **JAVA** – Ray Tracer
- **LEAN** – Compiler from Jack to VM

### 🧰 Tools & Libraries:
- **Flutter** / **Mix**
- **React (JS & TypeScript)** – Modular, canvas-based apps
- **Pandas**, **functools**, **random**, **names** (for realistic data generation)
- **VS Code**, **Git**, **Figma**, **Postman**

### 🗃️ Databases:
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- SQLite
